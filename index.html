            <span id="shortIntro">My name is Roger Jin, and I am currently a first-year student at Carnegie Mellon 
                    University studying Statistics and Machine Learning with an intended additional major in Business Administration. 
                    I was born and raised in Shenzhen, China, and have been studying in the US since the start of middle school.
                        Aside from being a member of Alpha Kappa Psi, I am also involved in the Asian Student Association and the Tartan Links Golf Club.

            <span id="longIntro">When I first moved to the US, I barely knew any English. The culture shock, combined with the language barrier, put me in a very helpless position. 
                However, it was this environment that drove me and gave me the motivation to acclimate to this new culture and become fluent in English. In the process of seeking to improve, 
                I developed a love for problem-solving, which I have carried with me throughout my high school years and continue to apply today. As of right now, I plan to pursue a career in consulting, 
                where I can continue to utilize and further develop the skills I love. Beyond my professional goals, I enjoy playing golf, exploring, traveling, and trying new things.
